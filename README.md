# Dataset:
I used a dataset that included a CT scan of the brain images. It has training set, and a test set. Each of them had 4 folders, three of which were related to three types of tumors, and the other folder was CT scan images of the brain without tumors.

# Feature Exraction Phase:
The feature extraction stage was performed by CNN and LSTM algorithms

# Recognition Phase:
This phase focuses on recognizing brain tumors. The recognition phase makes use of SVM, decision tree, and KNN algorithm classifires.
